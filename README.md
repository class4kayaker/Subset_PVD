PVD Subset Archive Generator
====

In a number of situations, it is desirable to generate a much larger set of
visualization files, and only routinely examine a subset. The script will for
the case of ASPECT vtu output, generate a valid PVD file containing only a
subset of the visualized timesteps then create an archive containing said
subset pvd file with all of the required referenced files.
